# SAMS
The project is actually a web application that will assist the
faculty members in taking the attendance. The application
asks user as if a signed member or not. If not signed it asks to
sign up. Hence we have a database of all the faculty members
. The admin shall be the HOD of the branch who has the
requisite authority to assign which faculty has to teach which
branch. Due to the busy schedule of the faculties ,updating
attendance is really very cumbersome and may sometime
lead to wrong entry which eventually lead to mis-
interpretations.
Moreover the admin can also see subject-wise strength of
the class which is sorted date-wise. In this way it simplifies
the manual way of taking the attendance and submitting the
data to the HOD explicitly each day.
The HOD can not only see the fluctuation of attendance of a
day , but can also study it for week/fortnight basis as date-
wise attendance is also stored in our database.
The problem arises when one teacher is assigned multiple
courses to teach. We solved this problem also but keeping
separate track of different subjects being taught by the
faculty.


Thank You
